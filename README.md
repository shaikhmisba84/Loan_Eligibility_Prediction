# ML_PROJECT
The model for determining loan eligibility prediction has to be trained using a dataset that consists of data including data such as sex, marital status, number of dependents, income, qualifications, credit card history and loan amount to name a few. 
For this project, I make use of the dataset of loan. 
This project will require training and testing the data model using the method of cross validation. 
After using data visualization techniques, clean the data, fill in the missing values and applying differenty algorithms. 
I got the result of 99.87% accuracy
