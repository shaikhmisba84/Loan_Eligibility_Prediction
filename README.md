# LOAN ELIGIBILITY PREDICTION(ML Project)
The model for determining loan eligibility prediction has to be trained using a dataset that consists of data including data such as sex, marital status, number of dependents, income, qualifications, credit card history and loan amount to name a few. 
For this project, I have used the "loan" dataset. 
This project will require training and testing the data model using the method of cross validation. 
After using data visualization techniques, cleaning the data, filling the missing values and applying differenty algorithms. 
I got the result of 99.87% accuracy by using XGBoost algorithm.
